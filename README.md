# Overview

My goal was to create a simple Java application to demonstrate my understanding of the Java programming language. 
This project serves as a learning experience to enhance my skills and knowledge of Java.

## Software Description

The software I have developed is a "Number Guessing Game." It is a simple interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The application provides feedback after each guess, informing the user if the secret number is higher or lower, or if they've successfully guessed the number.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of developing this software is to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of Java programming language syntax.
- Learn how to create a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
- Practice event handling in Java, including mouse and keyboard events.
- Implement basic error handling and user input validation.
- Showcase my skills and knowledge to potential employers or collaborators.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools and technologies for this project:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** I used IntelliJ IDEA as my preferred IDE for Java development. It provides a robust environment for writing and debugging Java code.

- **Programming Language:** The entire application is written in Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language.

- **Libraries:** I utilized the Java Swing library for creating the graphical user interface.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:

- [Oracle's Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)

# Future Work

For future iterations of this project, I plan to make the following improvements and additions:

- Improve the user interface for a more polished look.
- Add options for customizing the range and difficulty of the game.
- Implement a high score system to track users' performance.
- Create a multi-player mode for more interactive gameplay.
- Optimize the code for better performance and maintainability.
